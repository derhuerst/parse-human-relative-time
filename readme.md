# parse-human-relative-time

Yet another package to **parse human relative time strings like "next Tuesday 3pm" and apply them to a date+time**.

```js
const {DateTime} = require('luxon')
const parseHumanRelativeTime = require('parse-human-relative-time')(DateTime)

// Europe/Berlin switched to DST at 31st of March at 2am.
const tz = 'Europe/Berlin'
const dt = DateTime.fromISO('2019-03-31T01:59+01:00').setZone(tz)

parseHumanRelativeTime('in 2 minutes', dt).toISO({
	suppressSeconds: true,
	suppressMilliseconds: true
})
// 2019-03-31T03:01+02:00
```

## Installation

```shell
npm install parse-human-relative-time
```

## Usage

When using `luxon`, note that [it currently always follows ISO weekdays (`0` = Monday) instead of the locale](https://github.com/moment/luxon/issues/373).

### [`date-fns`](https://date-fns.org) integration

```js
const dateFns = require('date-fns')
const parseHumanRelative = require('parse-human-relative-time/date-fns')(
	dateFns
)
const {format} = require('date-fns-tz')

// Europe/Berlin switched to DST at 31st of March at 2am.
const withoutDST = new Date('2019-03-31T01:59+01:00')
const timeZone = 'Europe/Berlin'

const withDST = parseHumanRelative('in 2 minutes', withoutDST)
format(withDST, 'HH:mm zz', {timeZone})
// 03:01 GMT+2
```

#### weekStartsOn

For date-fns we have an extra parameter for weekStartsOn, e.g.:

````js
parseHumanRelative('last week', new Date(), { weekStartsOn = 1})
// would return last monday
```

Default is 0 = Sunday.

### Lexing into instructions

```js
const lexHumanRelativeTime = require('parse-human-relative-time/lex')

lexHumanRelativeTime('next tuesday 5pm')
```

```js
;[
	// next tuesday
	['startOfWeek'],
	['addWeeks', 1],
	['setDay', 2],

	// 12:01 am
	['setHours', 17],
	['setMinutes', 0],
	['setSeconds', 0],
	['setMilliseconds', 0]
]
```

## Why yet another package?

**Other packages don't handle time zones correctly**, because they

-   mess up timezones (e.g. [`parse-messy-time`](https://github.com/substack/parse-messy-time)),
-   parse to relative milliseconds, in some [DST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) cases (e.g. [`parse-relative-time`](https://github.com/fczbkk/parse-relative-time) & [`timestring`](https://github.com/mike182uk/timestring)),
-   require or even monkey-patch a specific date/time library (e.g. [`relative-time-parser`](https://github.com/cmaurer/relative.time.parser)).

Some actually do it right, but don't support a lot of expressions, e.g. [`relative-time-expression`](https://github.com/Frezc/relative-time-expression).

This package **parses** a human relative time string (e.g. `next Tuesday 2pm`) **into a set of manipulation _instructions_ and applies them to a `Date`** using [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) or [`date-fns`](https://date-fns.org). It therefore separates parsing and manipulation, letting the date/time lib handle the complex topic of time zones.
